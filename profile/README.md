## About Soulver
Soulver is a revolutionary tool that blurs the line between a notepad and a calculator. It’s designed for the messy, real-world math we do every day—calculating tips, splitting bills, budgeting, converting units, or planning projects—where numbers and context are intertwined. Instead of a blank calculator screen, you get a text editor where you can write notes, questions, and calculations all together. Soulver intelligently identifies the mathematical parts of your text, solves them, and displays the answers inline, updating them live as you edit. This creates a clear, editable record of your thought process.

The application excels by being both intuitive and powerful. You can create multi-line calculations that reference previous lines, just like in a spreadsheet but much more freeform. Its deep understanding of units and real-time currency rates means you rarely have to look up conversion factors. For students, professionals, freelancers, or anyone who works with numbers in a contextual way, Soulver replaces the need to constantly switch between a calculator, a notes app, and a web search, providing a unified and incredibly efficient workspace for numerical thinking.
